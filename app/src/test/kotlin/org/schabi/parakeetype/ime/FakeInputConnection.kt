/**
 * In-memory fake [InputConnection] for unit-testing [TextInjector].
 *
 * Tracks the full field state including the composing span without requiring a real
 * Android editor.  The composing text is stored separately from the committed buffer;
 * [fieldText] exposes their concatenation (matching what a user would see on screen).
 *
 * Only the methods actually called by [TextInjector] have real implementations:
 *   - [commitText]         - replaces the composing span and appends committed text
 *   - [setComposingText]   - replaces the composing region content
 *   - [finishComposingText]- moves the composing span into the permanent buffer
 *   - [getTextBeforeCursor]- returns the tail of [fieldText]
 *   - [getTextAfterCursor] - returns empty (cursor always at end in this fake)
 *   - [getSelectedText]    - returns null (no selection)
 *   - [deleteSurroundingText] - removes characters before the cursor
 *   - [performEditorAction] / [sendKeyEvent] - recorded for assertions
 *
 * All other [InputConnection] methods are no-op stubs that return false / null / 0.
