# Test Audio Fixtures

WAV fixtures for the real-model test classes: `ParakeetEngineRealAudioTest`,
`RealAudioPipelineTest`, `ShortUtterancePipelineTest`, `StreamingParityTest` and
`AcousticCaptureIntegrationTest`.

## Format Requirements

All files must be **16-bit PCM, mono**. Sample rate can be anything (WavReader handles
resampling to 16 kHz). Files must be standard RIFF WAV — WavReader parses the WAV spec
(little-endian numeric fields, raw-ASCII chunk tags).

## File List

All speech fixtures are **synthetic** — Piper neural TTS or generated tone/noise. No
real human voice recordings are committed to this repository.

## Multi-Sentence Pipeline Fixtures

Concatenations of the single-sentence recordings above with 0.5 s pauses, used by the
full-pipeline no-loss / no-duplication battery in `RealAudioPipelineTest` (the
`pipe-*` tests). Each drives a multi-sentence dictation through the complete production
stack and asserts every sentence's words survive and no phrase is committed twice.

| File | Sentences (source recordings) | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `pipe-a.wav` | report + approach + package (3) | ~11.5 s |
| `pipe-c.wav` | appointment + reservation + slides (3) | ~12.5 s |
| `pipe-e.wav` | approach + plants + package + weather + wallet (5) | ~20.0 s |
| `pipe-f.wav` | medium-sentence (pangram) + long-sentence (2) | ~7.5 s |
| `pipe-g.wav` | train + pizza + appointment + reservation (4) | ~16.2 s |
| `pipe-j.wav` | weather + wallet + pizza (3) | ~11.3 s |
| `pipe-k.wav` | weather + furniture + pizza + train (4) | ~15.2 s |
| `pipe-l.wav` | report + appointment + weather + furniture (4) | ~15.5 s |
| `pipe-n.wav` | meeting + furniture + package + slides (4) | ~14.8 s |
| `pipe-o.wav` | weather + furniture + appointment + pizza (4) | ~15.7 s |
Speech fixtures are neural-TTS (Piper, `en_US-lessac-medium` / `de_DE-thorsten-medium`)
recordings. They are clean, studio-grade speech — a harsher test of the model than
noisy human dictation, but sufficient to anchor the pipeline against regressions.
Replace with real human recordings for higher-fidelity coverage; any standard WAV works.

## Running the Real-Model Tests

The model is **not** checked in. The real-audio tests skip gracefully when the model
directory is absent. To run them:

```bash
# 1. Build the model archive (same files the app imports, SHA-256 verified) and unpack it:
devtools/package-model.sh /tmp
mkdir -p ~/.cache/parakeetype-test-model/parakeet-ultra
unzip /tmp/parakeet-ultra-int8.zip -d ~/.cache/parakeetype-test-model/parakeet-ultra

# 2. Run the tests (model dir resolution: -Dtest.model.dir > $PARAKEETYPE_TEST_MODEL_DIR > cache dir)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

Expected runtime: ~30–60 s on a desktop CPU (INT8, 2 intra-op threads).

## Generating Synthetic Fixtures

```bash
./gradlew generateTestAudio copyGeneratedTestAudio
```

This regenerates only `silence-only.wav`, `noise-only.wav` and `whispered.wav` — the
speech fixtures above are pre-recorded and are NOT overwritten.
