/**
 * Pure-function alignment utilities extracted from [TextInjector].
 *
 * All methods are stateless and side-effect-free, making them trivially testable
 * without an [android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection] or any Android dependency.
 *
 * The core algorithm ([findNewContent]) determines which words in a fresh transcript
 * are genuinely *new* compared to the words already committed to the text field.
 * It tolerates Parakeet's attention drift (dropped prefix, leading junk tokens after
 * an audio-window trim) by performing a three-layer overlap search:
 *
 *  1. **Full prefix match** - the happy path where `fresh` starts exactly where
 *     `committed` left off.
 *  2. **Suffix-prefix overlap** - the model dropped the beginning of the utterance;
 *     the longest suffix of `committed` that is also a prefix of `fresh` is used as
 *     the anchor.  Requires ≥ 2 matching words to avoid single-word false positives
 *     on common tokens ("nicht", "und", "ich").
 *  3. **Interior scan** - after an audio trim the model may emit 1-3 garbage tokens
 *     before settling into text that overlaps with `committed`.  This layer scans
 *     every interior position in `fresh` looking for the committed tail.  Also
 *     requires ≥ 2 matching words.
