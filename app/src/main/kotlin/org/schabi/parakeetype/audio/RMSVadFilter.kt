/**
 * A stateful energy-threshold VAD filter with onset gate, pre-roll buffer, and hangover.
 *
 * Call [process] once per [AudioChunk] in capture order. The method returns a
 * (possibly empty) list of chunks to forward to inference:
 *   - During SILENCE: returns an empty list.
 *   - On speech onset (after gate confirms): returns the pre-roll buffer + triggering chunk.
 *   - During SPEECH: returns a single-element list containing the chunk.
 *   - During hangover: continues returning chunks until silence is confirmed.
 *   - After hangover expires: returns empty lists again.
 *
 * Call [flush] when capture ends to reset internal state.
 *
 * ### Three smoothing layers (reference: Handy pipeline SmoothedVad)
 *
 * **Layer A - Onset Gate ([ONSET_FRAMES] = 2 frames / 64 ms)**
 * The energy must exceed [threshold] for 2 consecutive frames before the pipeline
 * transitions to IN_SPEECH. Suppresses single-frame activations from plosive pops,
 * finger taps, and brief noise events.
 *
 * **Layer B - Pre-roll buffer ([LEAD_IN_FRAMES] = 15 frames / 480 ms)**
 * A ring buffer of the last 15+1 frames is always maintained during silence. When the
 * onset gate fires, the entire buffer (including the onset gate frames themselves) is
 * emitted before the triggering frame. This captures the first consonant/phoneme of the
 * word that triggered the gate - the word would otherwise be truncated.
 *
 * **Layer C - Hangover ([HANGOVER_FRAMES] = 15 frames / 480 ms)**
 * After energy first drops below threshold, the filter continues emitting frames as SPEECH
 * for 15 more frames (450 ms). Captures trailing soft syllables (-ing, -ed, -s) and brief
 * inter-word pauses that momentarily dip below the threshold.
 *
 * @param sensitivity  [0.0, 1.0] - higher values require louder speech to pass.
