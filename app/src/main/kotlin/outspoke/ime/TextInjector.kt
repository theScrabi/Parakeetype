/**
 * Number of words to drop from the *tail* of the composing span when [TextInjector.resetAfterTrim]

 *
 * Composing words are inherently provisional - the model has only a single stride of audio
 * context when it produces them and frequently revises the last 1-2 tokens in the very next
 * stride after the audio window shifts.  If those tail words are permanently committed
 * (via [InputConnection.finishComposingText]) and the model then changes them, the field
 * contains a word that no longer appears in any subsequent partial.  [findNewContent]'s
 * overlap search - which requires a minimum of 2 matching words - cannot bridge that gap,
 * and every subsequent stride triggers an alignment recovery.  In a long recording this
 * cascades into dozens of recoveries (observed: 21R / 10T) and causes all content generated
 * after the bad commit to be silently dropped.
 *
 * By committing only the first `(composingWords.size - TRIM_COMPOSING_DROP_TAIL)` words
 * and discarding the tail, we guarantee that:
 * 1. At least [TRIM_COMPOSING_DROP_TAIL] stable words remain as the re-anchor tail in
 *    [committedWords] after the field re-read.
 * 2. The model's next post-trim partial almost always contains those dropped words (re-emitted
 *    from the trimmed window), so [findNewContent] finds a 2-word overlap immediately.
 * 3. No permanent mismatch enters the field.
 *
 * The dropped words are *not* lost - the model re-transcribes them from the overlapping audio
 * context that InferenceRepository keeps after the trim.

/**
 * Thin wrapper around [InputConnection] that writes transcribed text into the focused
 * text field, handling the composing-text lifecycle correctly.
 *
 * **Composing text** (shown underlined, not yet committed) is used only when the editor
 * is a text-class field and is not a password variant. All other field types receive
 * direct [InputConnection.commitText] calls with no intermediate composing span.
 *
 * **Sliding freeze window**: while recording, the last [MUTABLE_WORD_COUNT] words of the
 * partial transcript stay as composing text. Any word that leaves that tail window is
 * permanently committed via [InputConnection.commitText] so that model drift on later
 * strides cannot rewrite already-settled text. [commitFinal] only commits the words that
 * haven't been frozen yet.
 *
 * **Drift-resilient alignment**: frozen words are tracked as an actual word list, not
 * just a count. When Parakeet's attention drifts and a later partial starts from a
 * different word offset, a suffix-overlap algorithm locates the correct boundary between
 * committed and new content so no words are silently dropped or duplicated.
 *
 * **Session separator**: before injecting the first text of a new recording session the
 * injector checks whether the cursor is immediately preceded by a non-whitespace character.
 * If so, a single space is committed so the new transcript doesn't run together with
 * previously committed text (e.g. `"go.Now I lifted"` → `"go. Now I lifted"`).
 *
 * One instance is created per [android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService.onStartInput]
 * call and discarded in [android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService.onFinishInput].

     * **Three-step reset** that ensures the composing zone never loses words during a trim:
     *
     * 1. **Partially freeze composing span** - the *stable* leading words of the composing
     *    span are committed permanently while the last [TRIM_COMPOSING_DROP_TAIL] words are
     *    silently discarded.  [InputConnection.commitText] replaces the entire composing span,
     *    so the dropped tail is never written to the field.  Without this partial commit the
     *    old behaviour called [InputConnection.finishComposingText] which committed *all*
     *    composing words - including the uncertain tail that the model frequently revises on
     *    the very next stride.  When the model corrects those tail words the field is left
     *    with a token ("just", "cut.", …) that appears in no subsequent partial, permanently
     *    breaking [findNewContent]'s 2-word overlap requirement and cascading into dozens of
     *    alignment recoveries for the rest of the session (observed: 21R / 10T, stress test).
     *    The dropped words are not lost - InferenceRepository retains a short overlapping
     *    audio context after every trim so the model re-emits them in the first post-trim
     *    partial, and [setPartial] then anchors them correctly.
     *
     * 2. **Clear [lastPartial]** - after the composing span is committed the text the editor
     *    shows is no longer composing; the next [setPartial] must re-establish it even if the
     *    first post-trim partial text happens to equal [lastPartial] (which would otherwise
     *    be swallowed by the duplicate guard).
     *
     * 3. **Re-anchor [committedWords] from the field** - instead of trusting the tracked list
     *    (which may have accumulated alignment drift over multiple strides), read the actual
     *    text before the cursor as the ground truth.  The last [TAIL_COMMIT_WORDS] words of
     *    that content become the new alignment anchor, guaranteeing the suffix-overlap
     *    algorithm in [setPartial] can find the correct boundary without recovery.
